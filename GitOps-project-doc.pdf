Trying to build the Ultimate CI/CD Pipeline – GitOps for Deployment! 

I am working on an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that seamlessly integrates Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), using GitOps for the CD process.

This project leverages:
🔹 Jenkins for CI Automation
🔹 SonarQube for Code Quality Analysis
🔹 Helm for Kubernetes Package Management
🔹 Argo CD for GitOps-based Deployments
🔹 Complete Step-by-Step Setup:

Prerequisites:
✅ Java application code in a Git repository
✅ Jenkins server
✅ Kubernetes cluster
✅ Helm package manager
✅ Argo CD

 Step 1: Install Required Jenkins Plugins
🔹 Git plugin
🔹 Maven Integration plugin
🔹 Pipeline plugin
🔹 Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin

Step 2: Create a New Jenkins Pipeline
🔹 Configure a pipeline job in Jenkins with the Git repository URL
🔹 Add a Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline

Step 3: Define the Pipeline Stages
🔹 Stage 1: Checkout the source code
🔹 Stage 2: Build the Java application using Maven
🔹 Stage 3: Run unit tests (JUnit & Mockito)
🔹 Stage 4: Analyze code quality with SonarQube
🔹 Stage 5: Package the application into a JAR file
🔹 Stage 6: Deploy to test environment using Helm
🔹 Stage 7: Run user acceptance tests (Selenium)
🔹 Stage 8: Promote to production with Argo CD

 Step 4: Configure Jenkins Stages
🔹 Use Git plugin for code checkout
🔹 Use Maven Integration plugin for build & packaging
🔹 Run tests using JUnit & Mockito
🔹 Perform SonarQube analysis
🔹 Deploy to Kubernetes with Helm
🔹 Use Argo CD for GitOps-based deployment

Step 5: Set Up Argo CD
🔹 Install Argo CD on the Kubernetes cluster
🔹 Set up a Git repository for Argo CD to track Helm charts & manifests
🔹 Configure Helm charts for deployment

Step 6: Integrate Jenkins with Argo CD
🔹 Add Argo CD API token to Jenkins credentials
🔹 Include the Argo CD deployment step in the Jenkins pipeline

Step 7: Run the Pipeline
🔹 Trigger the Jenkins pipeline
🔹 Monitor all stages & troubleshoot issues


💡 Why GitOps?
By using Argo CD to track Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests, deployments become declarative, version-controlled, and rollback-friendly, ensuring a more reliable release process.

I'm excited about this project and looking forward to completing it! If you've worked on CI/CD pipelines with GitOps, I’d love to hear your thoughts. How do you structure your pipelines? Any challenges you faced?
